## FEATURES

Please refer to the [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) file for all features-related documentation.

---

## Design

The design of the application follows modern web design principles with a focus on usability and accessibility.
The central theme of the application is professional service delivery with intuitive navigation. A clean, minimalistic approach was used to create a functional interface without overwhelming users. As this application serves multiple user types with different needs, careful attention was paid to information hierarchy and user flow.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the application is based on professional and calming colors:

![Color Scheme](documentation/design/color_palette.png)

The design uses a sophisticated blue and gray palette that conveys trust and professionalism. The navigation uses dark gray (#343a40) with light text for clear contrast. The main content area features a clean white background with subtle gray borders and blue accent colors (#007bff) for interactive elements.

Button colors follow a semantic approach:
- Primary actions: Blue (#007bff)
- Success actions: Green (#28a745)
- Warning actions: Orange (#ffc107)
- Danger actions: Red (#dc3545)
- Secondary actions: Gray (#6c757d)

### Typography

The main font used in the application is the system font stack including -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', and Roboto. This choice ensures optimal readability across different operating systems while maintaining consistent performance.

Font weights are used strategically:
- Bold (700): For headings and important labels
- Normal (400): For body text and general content
- Light weights are avoided to maintain readability

### Imagery

- Icons are primarily sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to maintain consistency
- Pet and service-related imagery placeholders are included for future customization
- The application focuses on functional design with minimal decorative elements

### Wireframes

- [Tablet Wireframes](documentation/wireframes/tablet_wireframes.pdf)
- [Mobile Wireframes](documentation/wireframes/mobile_wireframes.pdf)
